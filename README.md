# 📱 CodeBreaker

CodeBreaker is an iOS app I built from scratch as part of my learning journey through Stanford's **CS193p – Developing Apps for iOS (2025)** course. The project explores core concepts like declarative UIs with SwiftUI, data flow and state management, animations, and data persistence with SwiftData.
